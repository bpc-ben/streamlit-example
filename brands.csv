Omnitrope,wikipedia,"Page: Growth hormone therapy
Summary: Growth hormone therapy refers to the use of growth hormone (GH) as a prescription medication—it is one form of hormone therapy. Growth hormone is a peptide hormone secreted by the pituitary gland that stimulates growth and cell reproduction. In the past, growth hormone was extracted from human pituitary glands. Growth hormone is now produced by recombinant DNA technology and is prescribed for a variety of reasons. GH therapy has been a focus of social and ethical controversies for 50 years.
This article describes the history of GH treatment and the current uses and risks arising from GH use. Other articles describe GH physiology, diseases of GH excess (acromegaly and pituitary gigantism), deficiency, the recent phenomenon of HGH controversies, growth hormone in sports, and growth hormone for cows.

Page: Sandoz
Summary: Sandoz is a division of the Novartis Group that focuses on generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars. The division was established in 2003, when Novartis united all of its generics businesses under the name Sandoz. Prior to this, the company existed as an independent pharmaceutical manufacturer until 1996, when it was merged with Ciba-Geigy to form the company Novartis. Before the merger, it specialized in medicines used in organ transplants, such as Sandimmun , and various antipsychotics and migraine medicine . Its headquarters are in Holzkirchen, Germany. Sandoz is one of the leading global generics business.

Page: Biosimilar
Summary: A biosimilar (also known as follow-on biologic or subsequent entry biologic) is a biologic medical product that is almost an identical copy of an original product that is manufactured by a different company. Biosimilars are officially approved versions of original ""innovator"" products and can be manufactured when the original product's patent expires. Reference to the innovator product is an integral component of the approval.Unlike with generic drugs of the more common small-molecule type, biologics generally exhibit high molecular complexity and may be quite sensitive to changes in manufacturing processes. Despite that heterogeneity, all biopharmaceuticals, including biosimilars, must maintain consistent quality and clinical performance throughout their lifecycle.Drug-related authorities such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) of the European Union, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Health Products and Food Branch of Health Canada hold their own guidance on requirements for demonstration of the similar nature of two biological products in terms of safety and efficacy. According to them, analytical studies demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product, despite minor differences in clinically inactive components, animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity), and a clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics). They are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and is intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.The World Health Organization (WHO) published its ""Guidelines for the evaluation of similar biotherapeutic products (SBPs)"" in 2009. The purpose of this guideline is to provide an international norm for evaluating biosimilars.The EMA has granted marketing authorizations for more than 50 biosimilars since 2006, (first approved biosimilar Somatropin (Growth hormone)). The first biosimilar of a monoclonal antibody to be approved worldwide was a biosimilar of infliximab in the EU in 2013. On March 6, 2015, the FDA approved the United States' first biosimilar product, the biosimilar of filgrastim called filgrastim-sndz (trade name Zarxio) by Sandoz.
