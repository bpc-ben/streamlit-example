If papilledema is identified, evaluate the etiology and treat the underlying cause before initiating treatment with SOGROYA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. 2.3 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring for Pediatric Patients with GHD \u2022 Recommended dosage of SOGROYA is 0.16 mg/kg based on actual body weight once weekly for treatment-na\u00efve patients and patients switching from daily growth hormone (somatropin). \u2022 Individualize dosage for each patient based on the growth response. \u2022 When switching from daily human growth hormone to once-weekly SOGROYA, choose the preferred day for the weekly dose. Take the final dose of daily treatment on the day before (or at least 8 hours before) the first dose of SOGROYA. \u2022 When switching from a weekly human growth hormone to once-weekly SOGROYA, continue once weekly dosing schedule. \u2022 Assess compliance and evaluate other causes of poor growth such as hypothyroidism, undernutrition, advanced bone age, and antibodies to recombinant human growth hormone if patients experience failure to increase height velocity, particularly during the first year of treatment. \u2022 Patients who were treated with SOGROYA for GH deficiency in childhood and whose epiphyses are closed should be reevaluated before continuing SOGROYA . 2.4 Recommended Dosage, Titration, and Monitoring for Adult Patients with GHD \u2022 Initiate SOGROYA with a dosage of 1.5 mg once weekly for treatment na\u00efve patients and patients switching from daily growth hormone (somatropin). \u2022 Increase the weekly dosage every 2 to 4 weeks by approximately 0.5 mg to 1.5 mg until the desired response is achieved. \u2022 Titrate the dosage based on clinical response and serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentrations. Draw IGF-1 samples 3 to 4 days after the prior dose. \u2022 Decrease the dosage as necessary on the basis of adverse reactions and/or serum IGF-1 concentrations above the age- and sex-specific normal range. \u2022 The maximum recommended dosage is 8 mg once weekly. 2.5 Recommended Dosage and Titration for Specific Populations Patients Aged 65 Years and Older Initiate SOGROYA with a dosage of 1 mg once weekly and use smaller dose increment increases when titrating the dosage [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. See above for monitoring recommendations and the maximum recommended dosage of SOGROYA [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment \u2022 SOGROYA is not recommended in adult and pediatric patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Hepatic Impairment ( 8.6 )]. \u2022 For adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment, initiate SOGROYA with a dosage of 1 mg once weekly and use smaller dose increment increases when titrating the dosage. See above for monitoring recommendations [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Pharmacokinetics ( 12.3 )]. The maximum recommended dosage is 4 mg once weekly. \u2022 For pediatric patients with moderate hepatic impairment, SOGROYA is not recommended [see Hepatic Impairment ( 8.6 )]. \u2022 No dosage adjustment is recommended for adult and pediatric patients with mild hepatic impairment. Women Receiving Oral Estrogen Initiate SOGROYA with a dosage of 2 mg once weekly [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. See above for titration and monitoring recommendations and the maximum recommended dosage of SOGROYA [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 2.6 Missed Doses \u2022 If the dose is missed, SOGROYA can be taken within 3 days after the scheduled dosing day. Once-weekly dosing for the next dose could be resumed at the regularly scheduled dosing day. \u2022 If more than 3 days have passed since the missed dose, skip the dose and administer the next dose on the regularly scheduled dosing day."], "dosage_and_administration_table": ["<table width=\"100%\"><col width=\"31%\"/><col width=\"27%\"/><col width=\"30%\"/><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\" styleCode=\"Rrule Botrule Lrule Toprule \" valign=\"top\"><paragraph><content styleCode=\"xmChange\">Strength</content></paragraph></td><td align=\"center\" styleCode=\"Rrule Botrule Lrule Toprule \" valign=\"top\"><paragraph><content styleCode=\"xmChange\">Dose increments (mg)</content></paragraph></td><td align=\"center\" styleCode=\"Rrule Botrule Lrule Toprule \" valign=\"top\"><paragraph><content styleCode=\"xmChange\">Dose Delivery Range (mg)</content></paragraph></td></tr><tr><td align=\"center\" styleCode=\"Rrule Lrule Botrule \" valign=\"top\"><paragraph><content styleCode=\"xmChange\">5 mg/1.5 mL (3.3 mg/mL)</content></paragraph></td><td align=\"center\" styleCode=\"Rrule Lrule Toprule Botrule \" valign=\"top\"><paragraph><content styleCode=\"xmChange\">0.025</content></paragraph></td><td align=\"center\" styleCode=\"Rrule Lrule Toprule Botrule \" valign=\"top\"><paragraph><content styleCode=\"xmChange\">0.025 to 2</content></paragraph></td></tr><tr><td align=\"center\" styleCode=\"Rrule Lrule Botrule \" valign=\"top\"><paragraph><content styleCode=\"xmChange\">10 mg/1.5 mL (6.7 mg/mL)</content></paragraph></td><td align=\"center\" styleCode=\"Rrule Lrule Toprule Botrule \" valign=\"top\"><paragraph><content styleCode=\"xmChange\">0.05</content></paragraph></td><td align=\"center\" styleCode=\"Rrule Lrule Toprule Botrule \" valign=\"top\"><paragraph><content styleCode=\"xmChange\">0.05 to 4</content></paragraph></td></tr><tr><td align=\"center\" styleCode=\"Rrule Botrule Lrule Toprule \" valign=\"top\"><paragraph><content styleCode=\"xmChange\">15 mg/1.5 mL (10 mg/mL)</content></paragraph></td><td align=\"center\" styleCode=\"Rrule Botrule Lrule Toprule \" valign=\"top\"><paragraph><content styleCode=\"xmChange\">0.1</content></paragraph></td><td align=\"center\" styleCode=\"Rrule Botrule Lrule Toprule \" valign=\"top\"><paragraph><content styleCode=\"xmChange\">0.1 to 8</content></paragraph></td></tr></tbody></table>"], "dosage_forms_and_strengths": ["3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS SOGROYA is a clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to slightly yellow solution available as follows: \u2022 Injection: 5 mg/1.5 mL (3.3 mg/mL) in a single-patient-use prefilled pen (teal) \u2022 Injection: 10 mg/1.5 mL (6.7 mg/mL) in a single-patient-use prefilled pen (yellow) \u2022 Injection: 15 mg/1.5 mL (10 mg/mL) in a single-patient-use prefilled pen (red) SOGROYA is a liquid solution available in a ready-to-use prefilled pen.

In the event of an allergic reaction, seek prompt medical attention ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Increased Risk of Neoplasm: Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or recurrence. Increased risk of a second neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors treated with somatropin \u2013 in particular meningiomas in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm ( 5.3 ). \u2022 Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus: SOGROYA may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. Monitor glucose levels periodically in all patients receiving SOGROYA, especially in patients with existing diabetes mellitus or at risk for its development ( 5.4 ). \u2022 Intracranial Hypertension (IH): Perform fundoscopic examinations prior to initiation and periodically thereafter. If papilledema is identified prior to initiation, evaluate the etiology and treat the underlying cause before initiating. If papilledema occurs with SOGROYA, stop treatment ( 5.5 ). \u2022 Fluid Retention: May occur and may be dose dependent. Reduce dose as necessary ( 5.6 ). \u2022 Hypoadrenalism: Monitor patients for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases in those with known hypoadrenalism ( 5.7 ). \u2022 Hypothyroidism: Monitor thyroid function periodically as hypothyroidism may occur or worsen after initiation of SOGROYA ( 5.8 ). \u2022 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients: May develop. Evaluate children with the onset of a limp or persistent hip/knee pain ( 5.9 ). \u2022 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients: May develop ( 5.10 ). \u2022 Pancreatitis: Consider pancreatitis in patients with persistent severe abdominal pain ( 5.11 ). \u2022 Lipohypertrophy/lipoatrophy: May occur if SOGROYA is administered in the same location over a long period of time. Rotate injection sites on a regular basis ( 5.12 ). 5.1 Increased Mortality in Patients with Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality has been reported after treatment with somatropin in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open-heart surgery, abdominal surgery and multiple accidental trauma, as well as patients with acute respiratory failure [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . The safety of continuing SOGROYA treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. SOGROYA is not indicated for the treatment of non-GH deficient adults. 5.2 Severe Hypersensitivity Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropin. Inform patients and/or caregivers that such reactions are possible, and that prompt medical attention should be sought if an allergic reaction occurs. SOGROYA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to somatropin or any excipients in SOGROYA [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.3 Increased Risk of Neoplasms Active Malignancy There is an increased risk of malignancy progression with somatropin treatment in patients with active malignancy [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Any preexisting malignancy should be inactive, and its treatment complete prior to instituting therapy with SOGROYA. Discontinue SOGROYA if there is evidence of recurrent activity. Risk of Second Neoplasm in Pediatric Patients In childhood cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head for their first neoplasm and who developed subsequent growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and were treated with somatropin, an increased risk of second neoplasm has been reported. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, were the most common of these second neoplasms. Monitor all patients with a history of GHD secondary to an intracranial neoplasm while on somatropin therapy for progression or recurrence of the tumor. New Malignancy During Treatment Because children with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting SOGROYA in these patients. If treatment with SOGROYA is initiated, carefully monitor these patients for development of neoplasms. There is risk of malignant changes of preexisting nevi with somatropin treatment in patients. Monitor patients on SOGROYA therapy carefully for increased growth or potential malignant changes of preexisting nevi. Advise patients/caregivers to report marked changes in behavior, onset of headaches, vision disturbances, and/or changes in the appearance of preexisting nevi. 5.4 Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. New onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients taking somatropin. Patients with undiagnosed pre-diabetes and diabetes mellitus may experience worsened glycemic control and become symptomatic. Monitor glucose levels periodically in all patients receiving SOGROYA, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, such as obesity, Turner syndrome, or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or pre-diabetes should be monitored closely. The doses of antidiabetic agents may require adjustment when SOGROYA is initiated. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in patients treated with somatropin. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, intracranial hypertension-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Perform fundoscopic examination before initiating treatment with SOGROYA to exclude preexisting papilledema and periodically thereafter. If papilledema is identified prior to initiation, evaluate the etiology and treat the underlying cause before initiating SOGROYA. If papilledema is observed by fundoscopy during SOGROYA treatment, treatment should be stopped. If intracranial hypertension is confirmed, treatment with SOGROYA can be restarted at a lower dose after intracranial hypertension-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. 5.6 Fluid Retention Fluid retention during SOGROYA replacement therapy may occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention (e.g. edema and nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paresthesia) are usually transient and dose dependent. 5.7 Hypoadrenalism Patients receiving somatropin therapy who have or are at risk for corticotropin deficiency may be at risk for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or unmasking of central (secondary) hypoadrenalism. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of SOGROYA treatment. Monitor patients with known hypoadrenalism for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.8 Hypothyroidism Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to SOGROYA. In patients with GH deficiency, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during treatment with somatropin therapy. Therefore, patients should have periodic thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated. 5.9 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis in Pediatric Patients Slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in patients undergoing rapid growth. Evaluate pediatric patients with the onset of a limp or complaints of persistent hip or knee pain. 5.10 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients Somatropin increases growth rate, and progression of preexisting scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Monitor patients with a history of scoliosis for disease progression. 5.11 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported in patients receiving somatropin. The risk may be greater in pediatric patients compared with adults. Consider pancreatitis in patients who develop persistent severe abdominal pain. 5.12 Lipohypertrophy/Lipoatrophy When SOGROYA is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue lipohypertrophy or lipoatrophy may result. Rotate injection sites when administering SOGROYA to reduce this risk [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. 5.13 Sudden Death in Pediatric Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome There have been reports of fatalities after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. SOGROYA is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to genetically confirmed Prader-Willi syndrome. 5.14 Laboratory Tests Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase may increase after SOGROYA therapy. Serum levels of parathyroid hormone may increase with somatropin treatment."], "adverse_reactions": ["6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse drug reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Severe hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Increased risk of neoplasms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Intracranial hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Fluid retention [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] \u2022 Hypoadrenalism [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] \u2022 Hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] \u2022 Slipped capital femoral epiphysis in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] \u2022 Progression of preexisting scoliosis in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] \u2022 Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] \u2022 Lipohypertrophy/Lipoatrophy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] \u2022 Sudden death in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] \u2022 Pediatric patients with GHD: Adverse reactions reported in \u22655% of patients treated with SOGROYA are: nasopharyngitis, headache, pyrexia, pain in extremity, and injection site reaction ( 6.1 ). \u2022 Adult patients with GHD: Adverse reactions reported in >2% of patients treated with SOGROYA are: back pain, arthralgia, dyspepsia, sleep disorder, dizziness, tonsillitis, peripheral edema, vomiting, adrenal insufficiency, hypertension, blood creatine phosphokinase increase, weight increase, anemia ( 6.1 ).

Table 4. Clinically Important Drug Interactions with SOGROYA Replacement Glucocorticoid Treatment Clinical Impact: Microsomal enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2HSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. GH inhibits 11\u03b2HSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GH deficiency have relative increases in 11\u03b2HSD-1 and serum cortisol. Initiation of SOGROYA may result in inhibition of 11\u03b2HSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. Intervention: Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of SOGROYA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Examples: Cortisone acetate and prednisone may be affected more than others because conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11\u03b2HSD-1. Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs Clinical Impact: Limited published data indicate that GH treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CP450)-mediated antipyrine clearance. SOGROYA may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes. Intervention: Careful monitoring is advisable when SOGROYA is administered in combination with drugs metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes. Oral Estrogen Clinical Impact: Oral estrogens may reduce the serum IGF-1 response to SOGROYA. Intervention: Patients receiving oral estrogen replacement may require higher SOGROYA dosages [see Dosage and Administration (2.5 )] . Insulin and/or Other Hypoglycemic Agents Clinical Impact: Treatment with SOGROYA may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. Intervention: Patients with diabetes mellitus may require adjustment of their doses of insulin and/or other hypoglycemic agents [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. \u2022 Replacement Glucocorticoid Treatment : Patients treated with glucocorticoid for hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of SOGROYA ( 7 ). \u2022 Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs : SOGROYA may alter the clearance. Monitor carefully if used with SOGROYA ( 7 ). \u2022 Oral Estrogen : Larger doses of SOGROYA may be required ( 7 ). \u2022 Insulin and/or Other Antihyperglycemic Agents : Dose adjustment of insulin or antihyperglycemic agent may be required ( 5.4 , 7 )."], "drug_interactions_table": ["<table width=\"513pt\"><col width=\"21%\"/><col width=\"79%\"/><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\" styleCode=\"Rrule Botrule Lrule Toprule \" valign=\"middle\"><paragraph><content styleCode=\"bold\">Replacement Glucocorticoid Treatment </content></paragraph></td></tr><tr><td styleCode=\"Rrule Lrule Botrule \" valign=\"middle\"><paragraph><content styleCode=\"italics\">Clinical Impact:</content></paragraph></td><td styleCode=\"Rrule Lrule Toprule Botrule \" valign=\"middle\"><paragraph>Microsomal enzyme 11&#x3B2;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11&#x3B2;HSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue.

In animal reproduction studies, subcutaneously administered somapacitan-beco was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 12 times the clinical exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/week. No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in a pre- and post-natal development study with administration of somapacitan-beco to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at approximately 275 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD (see Data) . The background risk of birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in rats, somapacitan-beco was administered by subcutaneous injection at doses of 2, 6, and 18 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis from gestation day 6 to 17. Fetal viability and development were not affected at doses up to 6 mg/kg/day (31 times the MRHD, based on AUC). Transient, fetal skeletal variations (short/bent/thickened long bones) were observed at 18 mg/kg/day (261 times the MRHD, based on AUC). In an embryo-fetal development study in rabbits, somapacitan-beco was administered by subcutaneous injection at doses of 1, 3, and 9 mg/kg every two days during the period of organogenesis from gestation day 6 to 18. Fetal viability and development were not adversely affected at somapacitan-beco dose of 1 mg/kg/every two days (12 times the MRHD, based on AUC). Reduced fetal growth was observed at doses \u22653 mg/kg/every two days (\u2265130 times the MRHD, based on C 12h ). In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant rats, somapacitan-beco was administered by subcutaneous injection at doses of 4, 9, and 18 mg/kg twice a week from gestation day 6 through lactation day 18. No adverse developmental effects were observed in the offspring at doses up to 9 mg/kg (275 times the MRHD, based on AUC). Increased incidence of renal pelvic dilatation was observed on post-natal day 21 at 18 mg/kg (630 times the MRHD, based on AUC), but was not observed in the adult F1 generation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of somapacitan-beco in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Somapacitan-beco-related material was secreted into milk of lactating rats. When a substance is present in animal milk, it is likely that the substance will be present in human milk . Available published data describing administration of short-acting recombinant growth hormone (rhGH) to lactating women for 7 days reported that short-acting rhGH did not increase the normal breastmilk concentration of growth hormone and no adverse effects were reported in breastfed infants. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for SOGROYA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from SOGROYA or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of SOGROYA have been established for the treatment of growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone (GH) in pediatric patients 2.5 years of age and older. The use of SOGROYA for this indication is supported by evidence from a 52 week randomized, multi-center, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group phase 3 trial in 200 treatment-na\u00efve, pediatric patients with GHD. The safety profile from the pediatric trial was similar to that reported in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Risks in pediatric patients associated with growth hormone use include: \u2022 Sudden death in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome. SOGROYA is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients with growth failure secondary to genetically confirmed Prader-Willi syndrome. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] \u2022 Increased risk of second neoplasm in pediatric cancer survivors treated with radiation to the brain and/or head [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Slipped capital femoral epiphysis in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] \u2022 Progression of preexisting scoliosis in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] \u2022 Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] The safety and effectiveness of SOGROYA for the treatment of growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone have not been established in pediatric patients less than 2.5 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use In clinical studies a total of 52 (15.6%) of the 333 SOGROYA-treated patients were 65 years or older and 3 (0.9%) were 75 years or older [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Subjects older than 65 years appeared to have higher exposure than younger subjects at the same dose level. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the action of somapacitan-beco, and therefore may be at increased risk for adverse reactions. Initiate SOGROYA with a dose of 1 mg once weekly and use smaller increments when increasing the dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Adult patients: No dose adjustment of SOGROYA is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Higher somapacitan-beco exposure was observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, initiate SOGROYA with a dose of 1 mg once weekly and use smaller increments when increasing the dose. The maximum dose should not exceed 4 mg once weekly. Somapacitan-beco was not studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, use of SOGROYA is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Pediatric patients: Based on the hepatic impairment study in adults, no dose adjustment of SOGROYA is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Higher systemic exposure of SOGROYA is expected in pediatric patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment; therefore, SOGROYA is not recommended in these pediatric patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] ."], "pregnancy": ["8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on the use of SOGROYA during pregnancy; however, published studies describing the use of short-acting recombinant growth hormone (rhGH) during pregnancy over several decades have not identified any drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.

The albumin-binding moiety (side-chain) consists of an albumin binder and a hydrophilic spacer attached to position 101 of the protein. The protein part consists of 191 amino acids. Somapacitan-beco is produced in Escherichia coli by recombinant DNA technology. The molecular formula (including the albumin-binding moiety) is C 1038 H 1609 N 273 O 319 S 9 and the molecular weight is 23305.10 g/mol, of which the albumin-binding moiety is 1191.39 g/mol. Structural Formula: SOGROYA ( somapacitan-beco) injection is supplied as a sterile, clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to slightly yellow solution for subcutaneous use in a single-patient-use prefilled pen with a deliverable volume of 1.5 mL. Each mL of SOGROYA 5 mg/1.5 mL prefilled pen contains 3.3 mg of somapacitan-beco, histidine (0.68 mg), mannitol (44 mg), phenol (4 mg), poloxamer 188 (1 mg), and Water for Injection, USP. The pH is approximately 6.8. Hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust the pH. Each mL of SOGROYA 10 mg/1.5 mL prefilled pen contains 6.7 mg of somapacitan-beco, histidine (0.68 mg), mannitol (44 mg), phenol (4 mg), poloxamer 188 (1 mg), and Water for Injection, USP. The pH is approximately 6.8. Hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust the pH.

The pH is approximately 6.8. Hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust the pH. Image of molecule structure"], "clinical_pharmacology": ["12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Somapacitan-beco binds to a dimeric GH receptor in the cell membrane of target cells resulting in intracellular signal transduction and a host of pharmacodynamic effects. Some of these pharmacodynamic effects are primarily mediated by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) produced in the liver, while others are primarily a consequence of the direct effects of somapacitan-beco. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics IGF-1 was measured to assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of somapacitan-beco. Somapacitan-beco normalizes the mean IGF-1 standard deviation score (SDS) level from a baseline value below -2 to a value within the reference range (-2 to +2) in treatment-na\u00efve adult patients with GHD [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . In adult patients with GHD (n=26), somapacitan-beco induces a less than dose proportional IGF-1 response at steady state. Maximum IGF-1 concentrations were observed within 2 to 4 days after dosing. Similar to the somapacitan-beco exposure time course, a steady state IGF-1 response was reached after 1 to 2 weekly doses with limited cumulative IGF-1 response. In pediatric patients with GHD aged 2.5 to 11 years, somapacitan-beco produces a dose linear IGF-1 response, with a change of 0.02 mg/kg on average resulting in a change in IGF-1 standard deviation score (SDS) of 0.32. Approximately 97% of pediatric patients achieved an average IGF-1 SDS level within normal range after 52 weeks of treatment with once weekly Sogroya in Study NCT03811535. IGF-1 SDS levels were -2.03 at baseline and the IGF-1 SDS level change from baseline was 2.36. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Somapacitan-beco has pharmacokinetic properties compatible with once weekly administration. The reversible binding to endogenous albumin delays elimination of somapacitan and thereby prolongs the in vivo half-life and duration of action. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of somapacitan-beco following subcutaneous administration have been investigated at clinically relevant doses (e.g., 0.01 to 0.32 mg/kg in healthy adults, 0.02 to 0.12 mg/kg in adults with GHD, and 0.02 to 0.16 mg/kg in pediatric patient with GHD)\u200e. Overall, somapacitan-beco displays non-linear pharmacokinetics, however in the clinically relevant dose range of somapacitan-beco in adults with GHD, somapacitan-beco pharmacokinetics are approximately linear. After subcutaneous administration of 0.02 \u2013 0.16 mg/kg/week somapacitan-beco in pediatric patients with GHD, a non-linear dose-exposure relationship with a greater than dose proportional increase in exposure was observed. Absorption In adults with GHD, a maximum concentration of somapacitan-beco is reached 4 to 24 hours post dose. Steady state exposure is achieved following 1 to 2 weeks of once weekly administration of subcutaneous somapacitan-beco. In pediatric patients with GHD, maximum somapacitan-beco concentrations occurred 8 to 25 hours after dosing at doses from 0.02 mg/kg/week to 0.16 mg/kg/week and increased with increasing dose level. Steady state was achieved following 1 to 2 weekly administration. Distribution Somapacitan-beco is extensively bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. Based on population PK analyses, the estimated volume of distribution (V/F) of somapacitan-beco in adult GHD patients is approximately 14.6 L and 1.7 L in pediatric patients with GHD. Elimination The plasma elimination half-life of somapacitan-beco is approximately 2 to 3 days in adult patients with GHD. Following a dose of 0.16 mg/kg/week, the terminal half-life of somapacitan-beco was about 34 hours in pediatric patients with GHD. Somapacitan-beco was cleared within one week after treatment discontinuation. Metabolism: Somapacitan-beco is metabolized via proteolytic cleavage of the linker sequence between the peptide backbone and albumin binder sidechain. Excretion: The primary excretion routes of somapacitan-beco-related material are via the urine and feces. Approximately 81% of the dose is excreted in the urine and approximately 13% is excreted in the feces. No intact somapacitan-beco is excreted indicating full breakdown of somapacitan-beco prior to excretion. Specific Populations Body weight : Adults with GHD -The exposure of somapacitan-beco decreases with increasing body weight. However, the somapacitan-beco dose range of 0.1 to 8 mg/week provides adequate systemic exposure to reach target IGF-1 levels over the weight range of 34.5-150.5 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Pediatric patients with GHD: Based on pharmacokinetic analysis, gender and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics. The exposure of somapacitan-beco decreases with increasing body weight. However, the somapacitan-beco dose of 0.16 mg/kg/week provides adequate systemic exposure for pediatrics to reach target IGF-1 levels over the weight range of 9.9 to 61.8 kg evaluated in the clinical trials. Geriatric patients: Adult patients greater than 65 years of age and geriatric patients have a higher exposure than younger subjects at the same somapacitan-beco dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Female patients receiving estrogen: Female patients and in particular female patients on oral estrogen, have lower exposure than males at the same somapacitan-beco dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Hepatic impairment: A somapacitan-beco dose of 0.08 mg/kg at steady state resulted in comparable somapacitan-beco exposure between patients with normal hepatic function and mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). However, higher exposure was observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) (ratios to normal hepatic function were 4.69 and 3.52-fold increase for AUC 0-168h and C max , respectively). Lower somapacitan-beco stimulated IGF-1 levels were observed in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (ratios to normal hepatic function were 0.85 and 0.75, respectively) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal impairment: In general, somapacitan-beco exposure tended to increase with decreasing estimated glomerular filtration rate. A somapacitan-beco dose of 0.08 mg/kg at steady state resulted in higher exposures in patients with renal impairment, that was most pronounced for patients with severe renal impairment and patients requiring hemodialysis (AUC 0-168h ratios to normal renal function were 1.75 and 1.63, respectively). Higher IGF-1 AUC 0-168h levels were also observed in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment and in patients requiring hemodialysis (ratios to normal renal function were 1.35, 1.40 and 1.24, respectively). 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, include those of SOGROYA or other growth hormone analogs. No anti-somapacitan-beco antibodies were detected in the clinical trials in adult patients with GHD. Anti-somapacitan-beco binding antibodies were evaluated in samples collected at baseline, week 13, and week 52 of treatment in the 52-week main period of the phase 3 trial in pediatric patients with GHD receiving somapacitan-beco. Of the 132 subjects exposed to somapacitan-beco, 16 (12.1%) showed detectable binding antibodies to somapacitan-beco at any time during the main period of the trial following exposure to SOGROYA. 14 out of 16 subjects showed detectable binding antibodies to somapacitan-beco only at one timepoint. Of the 68 patients exposed to daily somatropin, detectable binding antibodies were detected in 7 (10.3%) children. Of these, 6 children had positive antibody samples only at one timepoint. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-drug antibodies on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, or effectiveness of SOGROYA over the treatment duration. No neutralizing antibodies to somapacitan-beco were detected."], "mechanism_of_action": ["12.1 Mechanism of Action Somapacitan-beco binds to a dimeric GH receptor in the cell membrane of target cells resulting in intracellular signal transduction and a host of pharmacodynamic effects. Some of these pharmacodynamic effects are primarily mediated by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) produced in the liver, while others are primarily a consequence of the direct effects of somapacitan-beco."], "pharmacodynamics": ["12.2 Pharmacodynamics IGF-1 was measured to assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of somapacitan-beco. Somapacitan-beco normalizes the mean IGF-1 standard deviation score (SDS) level from a baseline value below -2 to a value within the reference range (-2 to +2) in treatment-na\u00efve adult patients with GHD [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . In adult patients with GHD (n=26), somapacitan-beco induces a less than dose proportional IGF-1 response at steady state. Maximum IGF-1 concentrations were observed within 2 to 4 days after dosing. Similar to the somapacitan-beco exposure time course, a steady state IGF-1 response was reached after 1 to 2 weekly doses with limited cumulative IGF-1 response. In pediatric patients with GHD aged 2.5 to 11 years, somapacitan-beco produces a dose linear IGF-1 response, with a change of 0.02 mg/kg on average resulting in a change in IGF-1 standard deviation score (SDS) of 0.32. Approximately 97% of pediatric patients achieved an average IGF-1 SDS level within normal range after 52 weeks of treatment with once weekly Sogroya in Study NCT03811535. IGF-1 SDS levels were -2.03 at baseline and the IGF-1 SDS level change from baseline was 2.36."], "pharmacokinetics": ["12.3 Pharmacokinetics Somapacitan-beco has pharmacokinetic properties compatible with once weekly administration. The reversible binding to endogenous albumin delays elimination of somapacitan and thereby prolongs the in vivo half-life and duration of action. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of somapacitan-beco following subcutaneous administration have been investigated at clinically relevant doses (e.g., 0.01 to 0.32 mg/kg in healthy adults, 0.02 to 0.12 mg/kg in adults with GHD, and 0.02 to 0.16 mg/kg in pediatric patient with GHD)\u200e. Overall, somapacitan-beco displays non-linear pharmacokinetics, however in the clinically relevant dose range of somapacitan-beco in adults with GHD, somapacitan-beco pharmacokinetics are approximately linear. After subcutaneous administration of 0.02 \u2013 0.16 mg/kg/week somapacitan-beco in pediatric patients with GHD, a non-linear dose-exposure relationship with a greater than dose proportional increase in exposure was observed. Absorption In adults with GHD, a maximum concentration of somapacitan-beco is reached 4 to 24 hours post dose. Steady state exposure is achieved following 1 to 2 weeks of once weekly administration of subcutaneous somapacitan-beco.

Keep SOGROYA and all medicines out of the reach of children. General information about the safe and effective use of SOGROYA. Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Patient Information leaflet. Do not use SOGROYA for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give SOGROYA to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for information about SOGROYA that is written for health professionals. What are the ingredients in SOGROYA? Active ingredient: somapacitan-beco Inactive ingredients : histidine, mannitol, phenol, poloxamer 188, Water for Injection, and hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide (as needed) Manufactured by: Novo Nordisk Inc., Plainsboro, NJ 08536 This Patient Information has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Revised: 04/2023 Supplies you will need: \u2022 SOGROYA prefilled Pen \u2022 new injection needle. SOGROYA prefilled Pen is designed to be used with all Novo Nordisk disposable needles up to a length of 8 mm. \u2022 sharps disposal container. See Step 5 for information on how to throw away (dispose of) used needles and Pens. \u2022 alcohol pad \u2022 gauze pad How to use your SOGROYA Pen 5 steps you should follow for a SOGROYA injection: Step 1: Prepare your SOGROYA Pen Step 2: Check the SOGROYA flow with each new Pen Step 3: Select your dose Step 4: Inject your dose Step 5: After your injection For further information about your Pen see: Frequently Asked Questions and Important information Important information Pay special attention to these notes as they are important for safe use of the Pen. Additional information SOGROYA is a prefilled growth hormone Pen. It contains 5 mg of somapacitan-beco and delivers doses from 0.025 mg to 2.0 mg, in increments of 0.025 mg. SOGROYA is for use under the skin only (subcutaneous) for injection 1 time each week. Do not share your SOGROYA Pen and needles with another person. You may give another person an infection or get an infection from them. Do not use your Pen without proper training from your healthcare provider. Make sure that you are confident in giving an injection with the Pen before you start your treatment. If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the Pen, do not use this Pen without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the Pen. Step 1. Prepare your SOGROYA Pen \u2022 Wash your hands with soap and water. \u2022 Check the name, strength, and colored label on your Pen to make sure that it contains SOGROYA in the right strength. \u2022 Pull off the Pen cap. \u2022 Turn the Pen upside down 1 or 2 times to check that the SOGROYA in your Pen is clear to almost clear and colorless to slightly yellow (See Figure A). If SOGROYA looks cloudy or you see particles, do not use the Pen. \u2022 When you are ready to give your injection, get a new disposable needle, and remove the paper tab. \u2022 Push the needle straight onto the Pen. Turn the needle clockwise until it is on tight (See Figure B). Make sure the right pen is used. Especially if you use more than one type of injection medicine. Using the wrong medicine could be harmful to your health. Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of SOGROYA, and blocked needles leading to incorrect dosing. \u2022 Pull off the outer needle cap and throw it away (dispose of) (See Figure C). \u2022 Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away (dispose of) (See Figure D). A drop of SOGROYA may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you must still check the SOGROYA flow with each new Pen (See Step 2). Never use a bent or damaged needle. Step 2. Check the SOGROYA flow with each new Pen If your Pen is already in use , go to Step 3. \u2022 Before using a new Pen , check the SOGROYA flow to make sure the growth hormone can flow through the Pen and needle. \u2022 Turn the dose selector clockwise 1 marking on the dose counter to select 0.025 mg. You may hear a faint \u201cclick\u201d when you turn the dose selector (See Figure E). \u2022 1 marking on the dose counter equals 0.025 mg (See Figure F). \u2022 Hold the Pen with the needle pointing up. Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to \u201c0\u201d. The \u201c0\u201d must line up with the dose pointer (See Figure G). \u2022 Check that a drop of SOGROYA appears at the needle tip (See Figure H). If no SOGROYA appears , repeat Step 2 up to 6 times. If you still do not see a drop of SOGROYA, change the needle: \u2022 Carefully remove the needle from the Pen by turning the needle counterclockwise. Place the needle in a sharps disposal container immediately (See Step 5). \u2022 Repeat Step 2 again. Do not use the Pen if a drop of SOGROYA still does not appear after changing the needle and repeating Step 2. Call Novo Nordisk at 1-888-668-6444 for help. Step 3. Select your dose \u2022 To start, check that the dose pointer is set at \u201c 0 \u201d. \u2022 Turn the dose selector clockwise to select the dose you need (See Figure I). When you have selected your dose, you can go to Step 4. If there is not enough SOGROYA left to select a full dose, see Frequently Asked Questions . The dose counter shows the dose in \u201cmg\u201d (See Figure J and Figure K). Always use the dose counter to select the exact dose. Do not use the \u201cclick\u201d sounds you hear when you turn the dose selector to select your dose. Only the dose pointer on the dose counter will show the exact dose selected. If you select the wrong dose, you can turn the dose selector clockwise or counterclockwise to the correct dose (See Figure L). The Pen \u201cclicks\u201d sound and feel differently when the dose selector is turned clockwise, counterclockwise, or if you forcefully move it past the number of \u201cmg\u201d left in the Pen. Step 4. Inject your dose \u2022 Select the injection site. \u2022 SOGROYA can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area (abdomen) or upper legs (thighs) as instructed by your healthcare provider (See Figure M). Change the injection site every week. \u2022 Wipe the injection site with an alcohol pad and let the area dry. \u2022 Insert the needle into your skin as your healthcare provider has shown you (See Figure N). \u2022 Make sure you can see the dose counter. Do not cover it with your fingers. This could block the injection. \u2022 Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter shows \u201c0\u201d (See Figure O). The \u201c0\u201d must line up with the dose pointer. You may then hear or feel a \u201cclick\u201d. \u2022 Continue to hold down the dose button with the needle in your skin. If \u201c0\u201d does not appear in the dose counter after continuously pressing the dose button, your needle may be blocked or damaged. See Frequently Asked Questions . \u2022 Keep holding down the dose button with the needle in your skin and slowly count to 6 to make sure that the full dose has been delivered (See Figure P). \u2022 Carefully remove the needle from your skin (See Figure Q). If blood appears at the injection site, press lightly with a gauze pad. Do not rub the area. You may see a drop of SOGROYA at the needle tip after injecting. This is normal and does not affect your dose. Step 5. After your injection \u2022 Carefully remove the needle from the Pen by turning the needle counterclockwise (See Figure R). \u2022 Place the needle in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container immediately to reduce the risk of a needle stick (See Figure R). Always throw away (dispose of) the needle after each injection. For further information about safe sharps disposal, see Frequently Asked Questions . \u2022 Put the Pen cap on your Pen after each use to protect SOGROYA from direct light (See Figure S). See \u201c How should I store my SOGROYA Pen? \u201d. Do not try to put the needle cap back on. You may stick yourself with the needle. Always remove the needle from your Pen immediately after each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of SOGROYA, and blocked needles leading to incorrect dosing. How should I store my SOGROYA Pen? Before you use SOGROYA Pen for the first time: \u2022 Store your new, unused SOGROYA Pen in a refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). \u2022 Store your new, unused SOGROYA Pen with the cap on and in the original carton. \u2022 Do not freeze SOGROYA. \u2022 When stored in the refrigerator, do not store the SOGROYA Pen directly next to the cooling element. \u2022 Keep SOGROYA away from direct heat and light. \u2022 Do not use SOGROYA if it has been frozen or in temperatures warmer than 86\u00baF (30\u00b0C). \u2022 Do not use SOGROYA after the expiration date printed on the carton and the Pen. After you use SOGROYA Pen and there is still medicine left: \u2022 Store remaining SOGROYA in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) and use within 6 weeks. \u2022 Store your in-use SOGROYA Pen with the cap on and keep it in the original carton. Do not store SOGROYA Pen with the needle attached. If needed, unused and in-use SOGROYA pens can be stored out of the refrigerator. SOGROYA pens can be stored at room temperature no warmer than 77\u00baF (25\u00baC) for up to 3 days (72 hours) and then returned to the refrigerator. Throw away (dispose of) SOGROYA if it has been stored above 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C) for more than 3 days (72 hours) or in temperatures warmer than 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C). Always keep your SOGROYA Pen and needles out of reach of others, especially children. Frequently Asked Questions How do I see how much SOGROYA is left in my Pen? The Pen scale shows you approximately how much SOGROYA is left in your Pen (See Figure T). To see how much SOGROYA is left in your Pen, use the dose counter: Turn the dose selector clockwise until the dose counter stops. The dose pointer will line up with the number of \u201cmg\u201d left in the Pen. You can select a maximum dose of 2.0 mg. If the dose counter stops with the dose pointer lined up with \u201c2\u201d, at least 2.0 mg are left in your Pen. If the dose counter stops with the dose pointer lined up with \u201c1.7\u201d, only 1.7 mg are left in your Pen (See Figure U). What if I need a larger dose than what is left in my Pen? It is not possible to select a larger dose on the dose counter than the number of \u201cmg\u201d left in your Pen. If you need more SOGROYA than you have left in your Pen, you can use a new Pen or split your dose between your current Pen and a new Pen . Only split your dose if you have been trained or advised by your healthcare provider on how to do this. You may find it helpful to use a calculator to plan the doses as instructed by your healthcare provider. Be very careful to calculate your split dose correctly so that you do not give the wrong dose. If you are not sure how to split your dose using 2 Pens, then select and inject the dose you need with a new Pen. What if no SOGROYA appears when I check the flow? A. Your needle may be blocked or damaged, if no SOGROYA appears at the needle tip. Remove the needle as described in Step 5 and repeat Step 1 and Step 2. B. Your Pen may be defective, if SOGROYA still does not appear after changing the needle. Do not use the Pen. Contact Novo Nordisk at 1-888-668-6444. What if \u201c0\u201d does not appear after completing my injection? The needle may be blocked or damaged, and you have not received any SOGROYA , even though the dose counter has moved from the dose that you have set. Remove the needle as described in Step 5 and repeat Step 1 to Step 4. How should I take care of my Pen? Be careful not to drop your Pen or knock it against hard surfaces. Do not expose your Pen to dust, dirt, liquid, or direct light. See \u201c How should I store SOGROYA? \u201d Do not try to refill your Pen, it is prefilled. What if I drop my Pen? If you drop your Pen or think that something is wrong with it, attach a new disposable needle and check the SOGROYA flow before you inject (See Step 1 and Step 2). Do not try to repair your Pen or pull it apart. How do I clean my Pen? Do not wash, soak, or lubricate your Pen. If necessary, clean it with mild detergent on a moistened cloth. Frequently Asked Questions How do I throw away (dispose of) used SOGROYA needles and Pens? Put your used needles and Pens in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and Pens in your household trash. If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: \u2022 made of a heavy-duty plastic, \u2022 can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, \u2022 upright and stable during use, \u2022 leak-resistant, and \u2022 properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should dispose of used needles and Pens. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about safe sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.

See Step 5 for information on how to throw away (dispose of) used needles and Pens. \u2022 alcohol pad \u2022 gauze pad How to use your SOGROYA Pen 5 steps you should follow for a SOGROYA injection: Step 1: Prepare your SOGROYA Pen Step 2: Check the SOGROYA flow with each new Pen Step 3: Select your dose Step 4: Inject your dose Step 5: After your injection For further information about your Pen see: Frequently Asked Questions and Important information Important information Pay special attention to these notes as they are important for safe use of the Pen. Additional information SOGROYA is a prefilled growth hormone Pen. It contains 10 mg of somapacitan-beco and delivers doses from 0.05 mg to 4.0 mg, in increments of 0.05 mg. SOGROYA is for use under the skin only (subcutaneous) for injection 1 time each week. Do not share your SOGROYA Pen and needles with another person. You may give another person an infection or get an infection from them. Do not use your Pen without proper training from your healthcare provider. Make sure that you are confident in giving an injection with the Pen before you start your treatment. If you are blind or have poor eyesight and cannot read the dose counter on the Pen, do not use this Pen without help. Get help from a person with good eyesight who is trained to use the Pen. Step 1. Prepare your SOGROYA Pen \u2022 Wash your hands with soap and water. \u2022 Check the name, strength, and colored label on your Pen to make sure that it contains SOGROYA in the right strength. \u2022 Pull off the Pen cap. \u2022 Turn the Pen upside down 1 or 2 times to check that the SOGROYA in your Pen is clear to almost clear and colorless to slightly yellow (See Figure A). If SOGROYA looks cloudy or you see particles, do not use the Pen. \u2022 When you are ready to give your injection, get a new disposable needle, and remove the paper tab. \u2022 Push the needle straight onto the Pen. Turn the needle clockwise until it is on tight (See Figure B). Make sure the right pen is used . Especially if you use more than one type of injection medicine. Using the wrong medicine could be harmful to your health. Always use a new needle for each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of SOGROYA, and blocked needles leading to incorrect dosing. \u2022 Pull off the outer needle cap and throw it away (dispose of) (See Figure C). \u2022 Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away (dispose of) (See Figure D). A drop of SOGROYA may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you must still check the SOGROYA flow with each new Pen (See Step 2). Never use a bent or damaged needle. Step 2. Check the SOGROYA flow with each new Pen If your Pen is already in use, go to Step 3. \u2022 Before using a new Pen, check the SOGROYA flow to make sure the growth hormone can flow through the Pen and needle. \u2022 Turn the dose selector clockwise 1 marking on the dose counter to select 0.05 mg. You may hear a faint \u201cclick\u201d when you turn the dose selector (See Figure E). \u2022 1 marking on the dose counter equals 0.05 mg (See Figure F). \u2022 Hold the Pen with the needle pointing up. Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to \u201c0\u201d. The \u201c0\u201d must line up with the dose pointer (See Figure G). \u2022 Check that a drop of SOGROYA appears at the needle tip (See Figure H). If no SOGROYA appears, repeat Step 2 up to 6 times. If you still do not see a drop of SOGROYA, change the needle: \u2022 Carefully remove the needle from the Pen by turning the needle counterclockwise. Place the needle in a sharps disposal container immediately (See Step 5). \u2022 Repeat Step 2 again. Do not use the Pen if a drop of SOGROYA still does not appear after changing the needle and repeating Step 2. Call Novo Nordisk at 1-888-668-6444 for help. Step 3. Select your dose \u2022 To start, check that the dose pointer is set at \u201c 0 \u201d. \u2022 Turn the dose selector clockwise to select the dose you need (See Figure I). When you have selected your dose, you can go to Step 4. If there is not enough SOGROYA left to select a full dose, see Frequently Asked Questions. The dose counter shows the dose in \u201cmg\u201d (See Figure J and Figure K). Always use the dose counter to select the exact dose. Do not use the \u201cclick\u201d sounds you hear when you turn the dose selector to select your dose. Only the dose pointer on the dose counter will show the exact dose selected. If you select the wrong dose, you can turn the dose selector clockwise or counterclockwise to the correct dose (See Figure L). The Pen \u201cclicks\u201d sound and feel differently when the dose selector is turned clockwise, counterclockwise, or if you forcefully move it past the number of \u201cmg\u201d left in the Pen. Step 4. Inject your dose \u2022 Select the injection site. \u2022 SOGROYA can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your stomach area (abdomen) or upper legs (thighs) as instructed by your healthcare provider (See Figure M). Change the injection site every week. \u2022 Wipe the injection site with an alcohol pad and let the area dry. \u2022 Insert the needle into your skin as your healthcare provider has shown you (See Figure N). \u2022 Make sure you can see the dose counter. Do not cover it with your fingers. This could block the injection. \u2022 Press and hold down the dose button until the dose counter shows \u201c0\u201d (See Figure O). The \u201c0\u201d must line up with the dose pointer. You may then hear or feel a \u201cclick\u201d. \u2022 Continue to hold down the dose button with the needle in your skin. If \u201c0\u201d does not appear in the dose counter after continuously pressing the dose button, your needle may be blocked or damaged. See Frequently Asked Questions. \u2022 Keep holding down the dose button with the needle in your skin and slowly count to 6 to make sure that the full dose has been delivered (See Figure P). \u2022 Carefully remove the needle from your skin (See Figure Q). If blood appears at the injection site, press lightly with a gauze pad. Do not rub the area. You may see a drop of SOGROYA at the needle tip after injecting. This is normal and does not affect your dose. Step 5. After your injection \u2022 Carefully remove the needle from the Pen by turning the needle counterclockwise (See Figure R). \u2022 Place the needle in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container immediately to reduce the risk of a needle stick (See Figure R). Always throw away (dispose of) the needle after each injection. For further information about safe sharps disposal, see Frequently Asked Questions. \u2022 Put the Pen cap on your Pen after each use to protect SOGROYA from direct light (See Figure S). See \u201cHow should I store my SOGROYA Pen?\u201d. Do not try to put the needle cap back on. You may stick yourself with the needle. Always remove the needle from your Pen immediately after each injection. This reduces the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of SOGROYA, and blocked needles leading to incorrect dosing. How should I store my SOGROYA Pen? Before you use SOGROYA Pen for the first time: \u2022 Store your new, unused SOGROYA Pen in a refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). \u2022 Store your new, unused SOGROYA Pen with the cap on and in the original carton. \u2022 Do not freeze SOGROYA. \u2022 When stored in the refrigerator, do not store the SOGROYA Pen directly next to the cooling element. \u2022 Keep SOGROYA away from direct heat and light. \u2022 Do not use SOGROYA if it has been frozen or in temperatures warmer than 86\u00baF (30\u00b0C). \u2022 Do not use SOGROYA after the expiration date printed on the carton and the Pen. After you use SOGROYA Pen and there is still medicine left: \u2022 Store remaining SOGROYA in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) and use within 6 weeks. \u2022 Store your in-use SOGROYA Pen with the cap on and keep it in the original carton. Do not store SOGROYA Pen with the needle attached. If needed, unused and in-use SOGROYA pens can be stored out of the refrigerator. SOGROYA pens can be stored at room temperature no warmer than 77\u00baF (25\u00baC) for up to 3 days (72 hours) and then returned to the refrigerator. Throw away (dispose of) SOGROYA if it has been stored above 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C) for more than 3 days (72 hours) or in temperatures warmer than 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C). Always keep your SOGROYA Pen and needles out of reach of others, especially children. Frequently Asked Questions How do I see how much SOGROYA is left in my Pen? The Pen scale shows you approximately how much SOGROYA is left in your Pen (See Figure T). To see how much SOGROYA is left in your Pen, use the dose counter: Turn the dose selector clockwise until the dose counter stops. The dose pointer will line up with the number of \u201cmg\u201d left in the Pen. You can select a maximum dose of 4.0 mg. If the dose counter stops with the dose pointer lined up with \u201c4\u201d, at least 4.0 mg are left in your Pen. If the dose counter stops with the dose pointer lined up with \u201c2.8\u201d, only 2.8 mg are left in your Pen (See Figure U). What if I need a larger dose than what is left in my Pen? It is not possible to select a larger dose on the dose counter than the number of \u201cmg\u201d left in your Pen. If you need more SOGROYA than you have left in your Pen, you can use a new Pen or split your dose between your current Pen and a new Pen. Only split your dose if you have been trained or advised by your healthcare provider on how to do this. You may find it helpful to use a calculator to plan the doses as instructed by your healthcare provider. Be very careful to calculate your split dose correctly so that you do not give the wrong dose. If you are not sure how to split your dose using 2 Pens, then select and inject the dose you need with a new Pen. What if no SOGROYA appears when I check the flow? A. Your needle may be blocked or damaged, if no SOGROYA appears at the needle tip. Remove the needle as described in Step 5 and repeat Step 1 and Step 2. B. Your Pen may be defective, if SOGROYA still does not appear after changing the needle. Do not use the Pen. Contact Novo Nordisk at 1-888-668-6444. What if \u201c0\u201d does not appear after completing my injection? The needle may be blocked or damaged, and you have not received any SOGROYA , even though the dose counter has moved from the dose that you have set. Remove the needle as described in Step 5 and repeat Step 1 to Step 4. How should I take care of my Pen? Be careful not to drop your Pen or knock it against hard surfaces. Do not expose your Pen to dust, dirt, liquid, or direct light. See \u201cHow should I store SOGROYA?\u201d Do not try to refill your Pen, it is prefilled. What if I drop my Pen? If you drop your Pen or think that something is wrong with it, attach a new disposable needle and check the SOGROYA flow before you inject (See Step 1 and Step 2). Do not try to repair your Pen or pull it apart. How do I clean my Pen? Do not wash, soak, or lubricate your Pen. If necessary, clean it with mild detergent on a moistened cloth. Frequently Asked Questions How do I throw away (dispose of) used SOGROYA needles and Pens? Put your used needles and Pens in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and Pens in your household trash. If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: \u2022 made of a heavy-duty plastic, \u2022 can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, \u2022 upright and stable during use, \u2022 leak-resistant, and \u2022 properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should dispose of used needles and Pens.
